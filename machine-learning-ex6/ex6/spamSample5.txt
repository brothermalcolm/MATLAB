Good day to you,

How are you doing today? I sent this letter to you previously without
getting any response. I am re-sending it once more hoping it gets to
you this time and that you will confirm your position to enable me to
stop any further search. Please note this is not connected with any
deceptive intention as you may have anticipated.

My Name is David Smith, a registered lawyer in the United Kingdom, I
am contacting you in respect of my client, Mr. Andrei Borodin, who
needs a business partner for investment purposes. He is seeking for a
private company or individual good enough to invest his funds into any
profitable business. Mr. Andrei Borodin, has been in London since 2011
after being accused of fraud, and I can authoritatively inform you
here that he has been granted political asylum here in the UK.

More information about Mr. Borodin can be obtained here:-

The investment fund is Fourteen Million British Pounds Sterling
(14,000,000:00) and can be increased if necessary. If you are
interested, I can guarantee you that this exercise is straight forward
and has no encumbrance whatsoever attached. Upon the confirmation of
your full consent to participate, all the necessary information will
be made available to you.
I look forward for a good business relationship with you.

PLEASE REPLY TO THIS E-MAIL ID: d.mith247@gmail.com

Best Regards,
D. Smith Esq.
