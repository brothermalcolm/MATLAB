Dear Wealth Seeker,
If you stood this company up next to Google, you'd need a microscope to see it.
If Apple were a room, you could fit 949 copies of this company inside of it.
But if you look closely, you'll see that this teeny-tiny company bears a striking resemblance to Microsoft in 1986... right before it went on a 60,000+% run.
How so?
It makes the essential component of a $19 trillion technology... a technology that has the guys who practically invented the computer declaring "a new era of computing."
The details are just ahead inside a brand-new research report from The Motley Fool.
So if you're like me... if you're the kind of investor who has been looking to squeeze the last remaining millions out of this historic bull market (but just didn't know how)... this could be the one stock you can't afford to miss.
